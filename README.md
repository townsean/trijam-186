# trijam-186
Source code for Ashley's entry for Trijam #186. The theme is "I am a traveler."

[Trijam](https://itch.io/jam/trijam-186) is a weekly game jam where the goal is to create a game in under 3 hours of development time. Well Travelled was completed in about 8 hours of active development time.

## Synopsis

In Well Travelled, you've just returned from a trip around the world! As you review photos from the trip, can you correctly recall which countries you were in?

The objective of the game is to correctly identify which country is visible in the displayed photos. Try to guess all 5 countries correctly!
